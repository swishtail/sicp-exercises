# sicp-exercises
My solutions to some of the exercises in SICP. The files are Racket files with the `#lang sicp` prefix. Each file contains all of the definitions required to solve the problem (e.g. to write `accumulate-n`, one first needs a working definition of `accumulate`. Both definitions are given in the file `2.36-accumulate-n.rkt`).
